Hybrid Transformer with Multi-level Fusion for Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion,6ce450c597af9e47aa88aec9642b0c4753b7a536,10.1145/3477495.3531992,"Xiangnan Chen, Ningyu Zhang, Lei Li, Shumin Deng, Chuanqi Tan, Changliang Xu, Fei Huang, Luo Si, Huajun Chen","Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs), which organize visual-text factual knowledge, have recently been successfully applied to tasks such as information retrieval, question answering, and recommendation system. Since most MKGs are far from complete, extensive knowledge graph completion studies have been proposed focusing on the multimodal entity, relation extraction and link prediction. However, different tasks and modalities require changes to the model architecture, and not all images/objects are relevant to text input, which hinders the applicability to diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hybrid transformer with multi-level fusion to address those issues. Specifically, we leverage a hybrid transformer architecture with unified input-output for diverse multimodal knowledge graph completion tasks. Moreover, we propose multi-level fusion, which integrates visual and text representation via coarse-grained prefix-guided interaction and fine-grained correlation-aware fusion modules. We conduct extensive experiments to validate that our MKGformer can obtain SOTA performance on four datasets of multimodal link prediction, multimodal RE, and multimodal NER1. https://github.com/zjunlp/MKGformer.",SIGIR,2022,,Computer Scienc
Decoupled Side Information Fusion for Sequential Recommendation,501eb473c1ca97e66f7a0ff6379a00756d869d6c,10.1145/3477495.3531963,"Yu Xie, Peilin Zhou, Sunghun Kim","Side information fusion for sequential recommendation (SR) aims to effectively leverage various side information to enhance the performance of next-item prediction. Most state-of-the-art methods build on self-attention networks and focus on exploring various solutions to integrate the item embedding and side information embeddings before the attention layer. However, our analysis shows that the early integration of various types of embeddings limits the expressiveness of attention matrices due to a rank bottleneck and constrains the flexibility of gradients. Also, it involves mixed correlations among the different heterogeneous information resources, which brings extra disturbance to attention calculation. Motivated by this, we propose Decoupled Side Information Fusion for Sequential Recommendation (DIF-SR), which moves the side information from the input to the attention layer and decouples the attention calculation of various side information and item representation. We theoretically and empirically show that the proposed solution allows higher-rank attention matrices and flexible gradients to enhance the modeling capacity of side information fusion. Also, auxiliary attribute predictors are proposed to further activate the beneficial interaction between side information and item representation learning. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed solution stably outperforms state-of-the-art SR models. Further studies show that our proposed solution can be readily incorporated into current attention-based SR models and significantly boost performance.

Curriculum Contrastive Context Denoising for Few-shot Conversational Dense Retrieval,f54bf26032352ec6e773f13d906aee018700f68b,10.1145/3477495.3531961,"Kelong Mao, Zhicheng Dou, Hongjin Qian","Conversational search is a crucial and promising branch in information retrieval. In this paper, we reveal that not all historical conversational turns are necessary for understanding the intent of the current query. The redundant noisy turns in the context largely hinder the improvement of search performance. However, enhancing the context denoising ability for conversational search is quite challenging due to data scarcity and the steep difficulty for simultaneously learning conversational query encoding and context denoising. To address these issues, in this paper, we present a novel Curriculum cOntrastive conTExt Denoising framework, COTED, towards few-shot conversational dense retrieval. Under a curriculum training order, we progressively endow the model with the capability of context denoising via contrastive learning between noised samples and denoised samples generated by a new conversation data augmentation strategy. Three curriculums tailored to conversational search are exploited in our framework.

Fairness of Exposure in Light of Incomplete Exposure Estimation,77c1c734b21fdfbee0d8d032e8538948149b5410,10.1145/3477495.3531977,"Maria Heuss, F. Sarvi, M. de Rijke","Fairness of exposure is a commonly used notion of fairness for ranking systems. It is based on the idea that all items or item groups should get exposure proportional to the merit of the item or the collective merit of the items in the group. Often, stochastic ranking policies are used to ensure fairness of exposure. Previous work unrealistically assumes that we can reliably estimate the expected exposure for all items in each ranking produced by the stochastic policy. In this work, we discuss how to approach fairness of exposure in cases where the policy contains rankings of which, due to inter-item dependencies, we cannot reliably estimate the exposure distribution. In such cases, we cannot determine whether the policy can be considered fair. % Our contributions in this paper are twofold. First, we define a method called \method for finding stochastic policies that avoid showing rankings with unknown exposure distribution to the user without having to compromise user utility or item fairness. Second, we extend the study of fairness of exposure to the top-k setting and also assess \method in this setting. We find that \method can significantly reduce the number of rankings with unknown exposure distribution without a drop in user utility or fairness compared to existing fair ranking methods, both for full-length and top-k rankings. This is an important first step in developing fair ranking methods for cases where we have incomplete knowledge about the user's behaviour.",SIGIR,2022,,Computer Scienc
Self-supervised Video Retrieval Transformer Network,93d3b14ac1c5b86dc7ea2eef54d4541e4e2df57f,,"Xiangteng He, Yulin Pan, Mingqian Tang, Yiliang Lv","Content-based video retrieval aims to find videos from a large video database that are similar to or even nearduplicate of a given query video. It plays an important role in many video related applications, including copyright protection, recommendation, filtering and etc.. Video representation and similarity search algorithms are crucial to any video retrieval system. To derive effective video representation, most video retrieval systems require a large amount of manually annotated data for training, making it costly inefficient. In addition, most retrieval systems are based on frame-level features for video similarity searching, making it expensive both storage wise and search wise. We propose a novel video retrieval system, termed SVRTN, that effectively addresses the above shortcomings. It first applies self-supervised training to effectively learn video representation from unlabeled data to avoid the expensive cost of manual annotation. Then, it exploits transformer structure to aggregate frame-level features into clip-level to reduce both storage space and search complexity. It can learn the complementary and discriminative information from the interactions among clip frames, as well as acquire the frame permutation and missing invariant ability to support more flexible retrieval manners. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging video retrieval datasets, namely FIVR-200K and SVD, verify the effectiveness of our proposed SVRTN method, which achieves the best performance of video retrieval on accuracy and efficiency.",ArXiv,2021,,Computer Scienc
RankFlow: Joint Optimization of Multi-Stage Cascade Ranking Systems as Flows,96b6a86ecbb2b6fd2e0306bfb942137561ab5b1e,10.1145/3477495.3532050,"Jiarui Qin, Jiachen Zhu, Bo Chen, Zhirong Liu, Weiwen Liu, Ruiming Tang, Rui Zhang, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang","Building a multi-stage cascade ranking system is a commonly used solution to balance the efficiency and effectiveness in modern information retrieval (IR) applications, such as recommendation and web search. Despite the popularity in practice, the literature specific on multi-stage cascade ranking systems is relatively scarce. The common practice is to train rankers of each stage independently using the same user feedback data (a.k.a., impression data), disregarding the data flow and the possible interactions between stages. This straightforward solution could lead to a sub-optimal system because of the sample selection bias (SSB) issue, which is especially damaging for cascade rankers due to the negative effect accumulated in the multiple stages. Worse still, the interactions between the rankers of each stage are not fully exploited. This paper provides an elaborate analysis of this commonly used solution to reveal its limitations. By studying the essence of cascade ranking, we propose a joint training framework named RankFlow to alleviate the SSB issue and exploit the interactions between the cascade rankers, which is the first systematic solution for this topic. We propose a paradigm of training cascade rankers that emphasizes the importance of fitting rankers on stage-specific data distributions instead of the unified user feedback distribution. We design the RankFlow framework based on this paradigm: The training data of each stage is generated by its preceding stages while the guidance signals not only come from the logs but its successors. Extensive experiments are conducted on various IR scenarios, including recommendation, web search and advertisement. The results verify the efficacy and superiority of RankFlow.",SIGIR,2022,,Computer Scienc
Personalized Fashion Compatibility Modeling via Metapath-guided Heterogeneous Graph Learning,24132a12bb86258b702f44d5543eef758edeebc6,10.1145/3477495.3532038,"Weili Guan, Fangkai Jiao, Xuemeng Song, Haokun Wen, C. Yeh, Xiaojun Chang","Fashion Compatibility Modeling (FCM) is a new yet challenging task, which aims to automatically access the matching degree among a set of complementary items. Most of existing methods evaluate the fashion compatibility from the common perspective, but overlook the user's personal preference. Inspired by this, a few pioneers study the Personalized Fashion Compatibility Modeling (PFCM). Despite their significance, these PFCM methods mainly concentrate on the user and item entities, as well as their interactions, but ignore the attribute entities, which contain rich semantics. To address this problem, we propose to fully explore the related entities and their relations involved in PFCM to boost the PFCM performance. This is, however, non-trivial due to the heterogeneous contents of different entities, embeddings for new users, and various high-order relations. Towards these ends, we present a novel metapath-guided personalized fashion compatibility modeling, dubbed as MG-PFCM. In particular, we creatively build a heterogeneous graph to unify the three types of entities (i.e., users, items, and attributes) and their relations (i.e., user-item interactions, item-item matching relations, and item-attribute association relations). Thereafter, we design a multi-modal content-oriented user embedding module to learn user representations by inheriting the contents of their interacted items. Meanwhile, we define the user-oriented and item-oriented metapaths, and perform the metapath-guided heterogeneous graph learning to enhance the user and item embeddings. In addition, we introduce the contrastive regularization to improve the model performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world benchmark dataset, which verifies the superiority of our proposed scheme over several cutting-edge baselines. As a byproduct, we have released our source codes to benefit other researchers.",SIGIR,2022,,Computer Scienc

Here, we discuss research involving the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) to evaluate one aspect of the pedagogical content knowledge of teaching assistants (TAs): knowledge of introductory students' alternate conceptions in electricity and magnetism as revealed by the CSEM. For each item on the CSEM, the TAs were asked to identify the most common incorrect answer choice selected by introductory physics students if they did not know the correct answer after traditional instruction. Then, we used introductory student CSEM post-test data to assess the extent to which TAs were able to identify the most common alternate conception of introductory students in each question on the CSEM. We find that the TAs were thoughtful when attempting to identify common student difficulties and they enjoyed learning about student difficulties this way. However, they struggled to identify many common difficulties of introductory students that persist after traditional instruction. We discuss specific alternate conceptions that persist after traditional instruction, the extent to which TAs were able to identify them, and results from think-aloud interviews with TAs which provided valuable information regarding why the TAs sometimes selected certain alternate conceptions as the most common but were instead very rare among introductory students.

In this paper, we focus on how to effectively exploit the hierarchical topic to improve the keyphrase generation performance (HTKG). Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical topic-guided variational neural sequence generation method for keyphrase generation, which consists of two major modules: a neural hierarchical topic model that learns the latent topic tree across the whole corpus of documents, and a variational neural keyphrase generation model to generate keyphrases under hierarchical topic guidance. Finally, these two modules are jointly trained to help them learn complementary information from each other.

However, most existing methods simplify the exercising records as knowledge sequences, which fail to explore the rich information that existed in exercises. Besides, the existing diagnosis results of knowledge tracing are not convincing enough since they neglect hierarchical relations between exercises.

This task has a high demand on the explainability of matching results because of its critical impacts on downstream applications --- the matched legal cases may provide supportive evidence for the judgments of target cases and thus influence the fairness and justice of legal decisions. Focusing on this challenging task, we propose a novel and explainable method, namely IOT-Match, with the help of computational optimal transport, which formulates the legal case matching problem as an inverse optimal transport (IOT) problem. Different from most existing methods, which merely focus on the sentence-level semantic similarity between legal cases, our IOT-Match learns to extract rationales from paired legal cases based on both semantics and legal characteristics of their sentences. The extracted rationales are further applied to generate faithful explanations and conduct matching. Moreover, the proposed IOT-Match is robust to the alignment label insufficiency issue commonly in practical legal case matching tasks, which is suitable for both supervised and semi-supervised learning paradigms. To demonstrate the superiority of our IOT-Match method and construct a benchmark of explainable legal case matching task, we not only extend the well-known Challenge of AI in Law (CAIL) dataset but also build a new Explainable Legal cAse Matching (ELAM) dataset, which contains lots of legal cases with detailed and explainable annotations.

From the popularity distribution shift perspective, the normal paradigm trained on exposed items (most are hot items) identifies that recommending popular items more frequently can achieve lower loss, thus injecting popularity information into item property embedding, e.g., id embedding. From the long-tail distribution shift perspective, the sparse interactions of long-tail items lead to insufficient learning of them. The resultant distribution discrepancy between hot and long-tail items would not only inherit the bias, but also amplify the bias. Existing work addresses this issue with inverse propensity scoring (IPS) or causal embeddings. However, we argue that not all popularity biases mean bad effects, i.e., some items show higher popularity due to better quality or conform to current trends, which deserve more recommendations. Blindly seeking unbiased learning may inhibit high-quality or fashionable items. To make better use of the popularity bias, we propose a co-training disentangled domain adaptation network (CD$^2$AN), which can co-train both biased and unbiased models. Specifically, for popularity distribution shift, CD$^2$AN disentangles item property representation and popularity representation from item property embedding. For long-tail distribution shift, we introduce additional unexposed items (most are long-tail items) to align the distribution of hot and long-tail item property representations. Further, from the instances perspective, we carefully design the item similarity regularization to learn comprehensive item representation, which encourages item pairs with more effective co-occurrences patterns to have more similar item property representations.
